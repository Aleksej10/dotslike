## About
see ***dots.pdf***  
  
## Dependencies

 - numpy
 - keras
 - tensor-flow
  
## Run
Game is fully implemented in ***python***:

 ```
$ git clone https://github.com/Aleksej10/dotslike.git
```
 ```
$ python3 play.py
```
## How to play
You start a game by picking side, ***1*** or ***-1*** (1 plays first).
On your turn you choose one of the unmarked lines on the board by entering line number (see ***lineNumbers.png***).
With lack of GUI the only way to play it is to have a board written down in front of you.
